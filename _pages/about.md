I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/). I do research in natural language processing and machine learning. My research aims to make tools for language understanding and generation **democratized** and **safe**.

I previously worked on the  [AllenNLP](http://allennlp.org) team at [AI2](http://allenai.org). I completed my masters in NLP at the University of Washington, advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). Before graduate school, I was a data scientist and software engineer at several companies in Seattle and Boston. Before that, I did research in computational neuroscience at the University of Chicago, working with [Jason MacLean](http://www.macleanlab.com/) and [Nicholas Hatsopoulos](https://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/Hatsopoulos/lab/index.html).
