I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/). I do research in natural language processing and machine learning. My research aims to make tools for language understanding and generation **democratized** and **safe**.

I previously worked on the  [AllenNLP](http://allennlp.org) team at [AI2](http://allenai.org), and I completed my masters in NLP at the University of Washington. Before graduate school, I was a data scientist and software engineer at several companies in Seattle and Boston.
